We have MongoDB installed on our computer, and now we are gonna learn how to use the shell to interact with MongoDB.
These are the basic command lines, and we must be familiar with them.

1. To view the name of the databases we have created, we use the following command:
show dbs

2. To create a new database, we use the following command:
use <database name>

3. To add a new collection to a database, we use the following command lines:
   Hint: you must insert one or many documents to the collection you make,
         and to do this, we use either insertOne() method or insertMany(). 
use <database name>
db.<collection name>.insertOne({})

3. To switch to an existing database to interact with it, we use the following command line:
use <database name>

4. To drop a database, we use the follwing command lines:
use <database name>
db.dropDatabase()

5. To drop a collection inside a database, we use the follwing command lines:
use <database name>
db.<collection name>.drop()
