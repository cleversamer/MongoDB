Let's discuss about how MongoDB strucutred.

MongoDB database has a collection/set of collections, and each collection has a documnet/set of documents.

For example:
Let's assume that we have a database for a social media app. This social media app has users, so we have a collection of users,
and each user is a document. Each document represents a user and it has the properties of the user.

MongoDB does not care about the schemas, so in our users collection, we can have a user document with a property that another one
does not have this property.

Take a look at the illustration.
