* The list of Comparison Query Operators:
1. $eq:  Matches values that are equal to a specified value.
2. $ne:  Matches all values that are not equal to a specified value.
3. $gt:  Matches values that are greater than a specified value.
4. $gte: Matches values that are greater than or equal to a specified value.
5. $lt:  Matches values that are less than a specified value.
6. $lte: Matches values that are less than or equal to a specified value.
7. $in:  Matches any of the values specified in an array.
8. $nin: Matches none of the values specified in an array.

* How can we use them?

1. Using $eq:
Let's find each employee with a salary 3100:
db.employees.find({salary: {$eq: 3100}})

2. Using $ne:
Let's find each employee that their salary is not equal to 3100:
db.employees.find({salary: {$ne: 3100}})

It is similar to {salary: 3100} except when the value is a reqular expression.
We will look to using reqular expression later.

3. Using $gt:
Let's find all employees that have salaries greater than 5000 (and not equal):
db.employees.find({salary: {$gt: 5000}})

4. Using $gte:
Let's find all employees that have salaries greater than or equal 5000:
db.employees.find({salary: {$gte: 5000}})

5. Using $lt:
Let's find all the employees that have salaries less than 5000 (and not equal):
db.employees.find({salary: {$lt: 5000}})

6. Using $lte:
Let's find all the employees that have salaries less than or equal 5000:
db.employees.find({salary: {$lte: 5000}})

7. Using $in:
Let's find all the employees that have any of these salaries [3100, 3600, 5000, 4800]:
db.employees.find({salary: {$in: [3100, 3600, 5000, 4800]}})

8. Using $nin:
Let's find all the employees that have not any of these salaries [3100, 3600, 5000, 4800]:
db.employees.find({salary: {$nin: [3100, 3600, 5000, 4800]}})
