In this lesson we are gonna work with $project stage.
It helps us in projection as we have been doing in the course using find() and findOne() methods, but the $project stage gives us
more functionality and flexibility.
So $project works in the same way as the projection works in the find() method.

So let"s project our data using $project stage.
We want to have only "gender", "name", "location", and "email", but the "name" field should be displayed in a different way:

db.persons.aggregate([{
    $project: { _id: 0, gender: 1, fullName: { $concat: ["$name.first", " ", "$name.last"] } }
}]).pretty()

HINT: we included "fullName" which is not exist but it will merge the first and last name on it.
HINT: to concatenate string we use the $concat stage.

Let"s repeat our projection and let the first and last name start with upper-case :

db.persons.aggregate([{
    $project: { _id: 0,
                gender: 1,
                fullName: { 
                    $concat: [
                        { $toUpper: "$name.first" },
                        " ",
                        { $toUpper: "$name.last" }
                    ] 
                } 
            }
}]).pretty()

HINT: $toUpper stage turn strings into upper-case.

We see that everything is upper-case, but we want only the first character of first and last name to be upper-case:

db.persons.aggregate([
    {
      $project: {
        _id: 0,
        gender: 1,
        fullName: {
          $concat: [
            { $toUpper: { $substrCP: ["$name.first", 0, 1] } },
            {
              $substrCP: [
                "$name.first",
                1,
                { $subtract: [{ $strLenCP: "$name.first" }, 1] }
              ]
            },
            " ",
            { $toUpper: { $substrCP: ["$name.last", 0, 1] } },
            {
              $substrCP: [
                "$name.last",
                1,
                { $subtract: [{ $strLenCP: "$name.last" }, 1] }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]).pretty();

HINT: $substrCP is a function that returns a sub of a string.
      First argument is the string,
      second is the starting index,
      and third is how many characters will be included.

HINT: $subtract performs subtractions.
HINT: $strLenCP returns the length of the string.
