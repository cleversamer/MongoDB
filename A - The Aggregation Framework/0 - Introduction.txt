Sometimes we need a bit more power for retrieving our data.

Now we are already extensively use the find() and findOne() methods and these are our default methods for retrieving data indeed,
but sometimes we want to do more complex transformations to our data.

Now of course we talked about the fact that we want to store the data in our database in the format we need it in in our application,
but this is not always possible.

We might have an online shop where the sellers can also generate detailed reports on their sales data, now it will probably be hard to 
store the data in exactly that format, because these reports might be customizable by the sellers or let's say we have a customer facing 
application on which our data scientists.

In our company also work, of course we will gear our data towards our customers and we will store it in a way that allows our customers to 
quickly interact with our application, and our data scientists might not be that important for us from a data modeling perspective.

Therefore, hence we also need more complex data transformation capabilities.

And in this section, we will have a look at the Aggregation Framework which gives us just that.

We'll learn what exactly the Aggregation Framework is in MongoDB and how we can use it to retrieve data in exactly the format we need 
it in our application.
