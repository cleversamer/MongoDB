In MongoDB, we cannot just query text, booleans, number, states, we can also query locations and with this, we are really talking about 
queries like find us all restaurants in this radius, or find us the nearest location to our current location.

So there are a lot of fun queries we can do with this so-called Geospatial Data.

* In this section, we will look at how we can:
1. Store Geospatial Data in the special GeoJSON format.
2. Query this Geospatial Data efficiently with the help of indexes and a couple of special operators 
   that are suited to work well with Geospatial Data.

So let's dive into this and let's start working with some locations and places.
