In this example, we have question and answer. The relation between them is one-to-many, because a single question may have multiple answers,
and an answer belongs to a single question.
We used the pattern of Embedded Documents, because there is no risk of 16MB, and the question does not have thousands of answers. So there is
no any danger if we use this pattern.

1. Let's import the data from the JSON files:
mongoimport questionThreads.json -d blog -c questions --jsonArray --drop

2. Preparing to interact with new database:
mongo
use blog

3. Let's find the first question in the database:
db.questions.findOne() 

4. Let's delete the database, because we don't need it any more:
db.dropDatabase()
