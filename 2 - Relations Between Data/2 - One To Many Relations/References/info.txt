In this example, we have cities, and citizens. Each city has citizens, but we cannot store each citizen inside their city document, and
that is because of the risk of 16MB limit, and each city may have millions of citizens. Also we cannot store the "_id" of each citizen inside
their city document.
The perfect solution in this case is to store the cityId/city name inside each citizen document, so we may have millions of citizens, and
tens of cities, so that is the perfect solution.

1. Let's import the data from the JSON files:
mongoimport cities.json -d country -c cities --jsonArray --drop
mongoimport citizens.json -d country -c citizens --jsonArray --drop

2. Preparing to interact with new database:
mongo
use country

3. Let's find the city that the first citizen in the database belongs to:
var cityId = db.citizens.findOne().cityId
db.cities.findOne({name: cityId}) 

4. Let's delete the database, because we don't need it any more:
db.dropDatabase()
