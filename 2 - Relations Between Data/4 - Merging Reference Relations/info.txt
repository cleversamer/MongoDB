* Let's create a new database called "librarry" to start work, use the following command lines:
mongo
use librarry
db.customers.insertOne({name: "Customer 1", favBooks: ["id1", "id2"]})
db.books.insertOne({_id: "id1", name: "Book 1"})

* Now we have a new database called "librarry" and two collection for customers and books.

* Let's use the $lookup and see the results:
db.customers.aggregate([{$lookup: {from: "books", localField: "favBooks", foreignField: "_id", as: "favBookData"}}])

After writing the previous command line, we are gonna see the customer document with a new field called "favBookData", and this field is an
array with all the references in the customer document.

HINT: after lookup, the original customer document will not be changed, the lookup just give us the same document with its reference objects.
