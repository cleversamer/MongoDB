In our example, the relationship between patient and summary is one-to-one, because one patient has one disease summary
and disease summary belongs to one patient.

To make a relationship between two documents, there are two patterns to do that:
1. Embedded Documents
2. Using References

* Embedded Documents:
In this pattern, we add the disease summary as a field to the patient document, so the patient document includes the disease
summary document.

* Using References:
In this pattern, we have two collections in our database (patients, and diseaseSummaries), each patient in the patients collection
has disease summary, but this disease summary is not stored inside it, the disease summary is stored in another collection, and each
patient document has the "_id" of its patient summary which is stored inside another collection.

* Strengths of Embedded Documents Pattern:
It is so efficient and avoid us the risk of extra queries. It helps us to get all the data we search for with a single query.

* Strengths of References Pattern:
It helps us when we update our data a lot, then we have a single place to modify the data we want.

* Weaknesses of Embedded Documents Pattern:
When we want to update our data, there are different places that we have to look for and modify our data.

* Weaknesses of References Pattern:
It does not work efficiently as the Embedded pattern, because to find data, we have always extra queries.
