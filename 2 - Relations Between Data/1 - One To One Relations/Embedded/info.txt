In the example of patient and disease summary, we used the pattern of embedded documents, because the embedded disease summary
documents does not impact the risk of 16MB limit for each document in the collection, so, the embedded documents pattern is perfect.

1. Let's import the data from the JSON file:
mongoimport patients.json -d hospital -c patients --jsonArray --drop

2. Preparing to interact with new database:
mongo
use hospital

3. Let's search for a patient has cold on their disease summary:
db.patients.findOne({"diseaseSummary.diseases": "Cold"})

4. Let's delete the database, because we don't need it any more:
db.dropDatabase()
