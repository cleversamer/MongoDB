In the example of person and car, we used the references pattern to store the data, because in real world project, if we implement this,
the car document may impact the risk of 16MB limit for each document, but that is not inside our implementation, it it in real world.
The car has many properties, information, and more data that needs some capacity, and to reduce the danger of capacity (16MB limit), we 
used the pattern of references, so each person is stroed inside the persons collections, and it has a car, this car is exist in the cars
collection, and the person just has the "_id" of their car in the cars collection, so we can find it, and we have to make an extra query.

1. Let's import the data from the JSON files:
mongoimport cars.json -d carsCompany -c cars --jsonArray --drop
mongoimport persons.json -d carsCompany -c persons --jsonArray --drop

2. Preparing to interact with new database:
mongo
use carsCompany

3. Let's find the disease summary for the first patient:
var carId = db.persons.findOne().car
db.cars.findOne({"_id": carId})

4. Let's delete the database, because we don't need it any more:
db.dropDatabase()
