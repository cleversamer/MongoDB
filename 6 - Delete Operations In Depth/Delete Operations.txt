* How can we delete document or multiple document in a collection?
1. To delete multiple documents:
db.<collection>.deleteMany({filter})

2. To delete a single document:
db.<collection>.deleteOne({filter})

* How can we delete all documents in the collection?
Using deleteMany() method, and not passing a filter argument to it.
db.<collection>.deleteMany() => This deletes the entire collection.

* How can we delete all documents that matches a filter?
Using deleteMany() method, and pass the filter as an argument to it.
db.<collection>.deleteMany({filter}) => This deletes all documents that match the filter.

* How can we delete only one document that matches a filter?
Using deleteOne({filter}) method. and pass the filter as an argument to it.
db.<collection>.deleteOne({filter}) => This deletes only the first document that matches the passed filter.
